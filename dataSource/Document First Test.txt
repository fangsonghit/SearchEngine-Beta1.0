Hold technical reviews of designs and code. Technical reviews are useful on projects as small as
one line of code. According to Daniel P. Freedman and Gerald M. Weinberg in Handbook of
Walk, Inspections and Technical Reviews, Third Edition (Dorset House, 1990), in one
software maintenance organization, 55% of one-line maintenance changes were in error before
introducing code reviews. After introducing reviews, only 2% were in error.
Use automated source code control. Automated source code control creates virtually no overhead
and pays for itself the first time you need to retrieve the version of the software you were working
on yesterday. It is useful on even the smallest, one-person projects.
Use defect-tracking software. One of the most embarrassing software errors is to release
software that contains an error that you knew about and simply forgot to fix. Like automated
source code control, defect-tracking software adds virtually no overhead to a project and helps to
prevent needless mistakes. Large projects typically need sophisticated, networked defect-tracking
software; small projects can get by with a tool as simple as a defect-tracking spreadsheet.
Create and use checklists. Checklists are an often-overlooked, low-tech development tool, but they
are useful in many areas. They are created from experience, so they're inherently practical. Use
them during requirements time to avoid missing key requirements. Use them at architecture and
design time to be sure your design accounts for all relevant considerations. Use them during design
and code reviews to help reviewers catch the most common problems. Use them at software
release to assure that, in the last-minute rush to release the software, you don’t make careless
mistakes.
The Most Important Lesson from Large Projects
Whether you’re building a deck or a skyscraper, it’s cheaper and easier to change your plans
during the diagram phase than during construction. A deck project might seem small by
comparison, but if you decide to move a support post after you’ve dug the post hole, mixed
concrete for the footing, poured the footing, set the post into the concrete, and let the concrete
cure, you’ll wish you had spent a few more minutes scrutinizing your design. (Believe me, I have the
